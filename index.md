## About Me

(coming soon)

## Research

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in the [Wide Bandgaps research group](https://www.mse.ncsu.edu/collazo/) where I work primarily on [electron microscopy](/em.md) characterization of defects in patterned AlGaN growths and doped GaN.  Some day that description will be more specific, but that day is not today.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Wenpei Gao](https://www.mse.ncsu.edu/people/wgao9/) working on various TEM samples and developing 4DSTEM analysis code, [Dr. Aram Amassian](https://www.mse.ncsu.edu/amassian/) on a high-throughput robotic synthesis and analysis platform for perovskites, and [Dr. James Cahoon](https://cahoon.chem.unc.edu/) studying photodeposition of catalyst materials on multijunction silicon nanowires.
